# Cega Smart Contract Event Handling

This project comprises two main components designed to interact with the Cega Smart Contract on the Ethereum blockchain. These components are responsible for listening to and indexing deposit and withdrawal events, ensuring robust data management and retrieval capabilities.

## Components

### 1. Event Listener
This component uses the `ethers.js` library to listen to specific events emitted by the Cega Smart Contract. It captures real-time data about deposits and withdrawals and stores this information in a PostgreSQL database, utilizing the Prisma ORM for efficient data handling.

### 2. Event Indexer
The Event Indexer, referred to as `Keeper`, indexes historical and real-time trades related to deposit and withdrawal functions. It synchronizes transaction data between the blockchain and a PostgreSQL database, supported by Redis for enhanced performance and reliability.

## Features

- Real-time event listening and historical data indexing.
- Data storage in PostgreSQL with support from Redis caching.
- Automatic reconnection and error handling capabilities.
- Detailed logging and monitoring of blockchain interactions.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or newer)
- PostgreSQL
- Redis (for the Event Indexer)
- Ethereum node access (Alchemy, Infura, etc.)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vivinvinh212/cega.git
cd cega

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.sample .env
vim .env

# Initialize the database
npx prisma migrate dev
```

## Project Structure

- `listener/`: Contains the setup for the event listener using ethers.js.
- `indexer/`: Houses the Keeper class and utilities for indexing events.

## Deliverables

- **Event Listener**: Listens for real-time deposit and withdrawal events and stores them in PostgreSQL.
- **Event Indexer (Keeper)**: Indexes past and ongoing transaction data, handling large volumes of data with Redis caching.
- **Documentation**: Includes detailed setup and usage instructions, along with inline code documentation.
- **API**: Features APIs to retrieve transaction details and history, ensuring data access is efficient and secure.
- **Roadmap**: Outlines future enhancements and expansions to support additional features and blockchains.

## Roadmap
Given the short time amount for the assignment, there are numerous items to improve the application

### Short-Term Goals
- Complete the api design for given purposes, improve performance by caching, authorization, etc.
- Align the schema, code structure and convention of listener and indexer
- Build services to automate the process and monitor container's health
- Enhance error handling and retry mechanisms for blockchain interactions.
- Implement a more robust logging system to facilitate debugging and monitoring.
- Optimize the Redis caching strategy to improve data retrieval speeds.

### Long-Term Goals

- Develop a graphical user interface to visualize transactions and analytics.
- Expand the system to support other blockchains and smart contracts.
- Incorporate machine learning to predict transaction volumes and identify anomalies.

### Strategic Initiatives

- Explore the use of decentralized storage solutions to improve data integrity and security.
